# Java Internship Tasks – @virtualvigilantes

This repository contains the Java-based console applications completed as part of my internship at **@virtualvigilantes**. Each task focuses on different core programming concepts in Java, such as OOP, exception handling, file I/O, and user interaction via the console.

## ✅ Task I – Basic ATM Simulator

A basic ATM simulator that allows users to:
- Check balance
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money (with balance check)
- Verify PIN before transactions

**Key Features:**
- PIN-based access
- Menu-driven interface
- Exception handling for invalid inputs
- Use of `Scanner` for input

## ✅ Task II – Student Grade Tracker

An application to manage student grades across multiple courses.

**Key Features:**
- Add and update student details
- Assign and edit course grades
- Calculate and display average grades
- Console-based interaction with loops and conditions for easy navigation

## ✅ Task III – Online Library Management System

A library management system where users and librarians can:
- Add, edit, or delete books (by librarians)
- Browse the book catalog
- Checkout books
- View user borrowing history

**Key Features:**
- Object-Oriented Programming with classes like `Book`, `User`, `Library`
- Borrowing history tracking
- Menu-driven console interface

## ✅ Task IV – Employee Payroll System

A payroll system to manage and calculate monthly salaries for employees.

**Key Features:**
- Two employee types: Full-Time and Part-Time
- Monthly salary with bonus and deduction calculations
- File I/O for storing employee records (`employees.txt`)
- Use of inheritance and abstraction

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 17 LTS version)
- File I/O (`java.io`)
- Console Input (`Scanner`)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Exception Handling

---

## 📁 How to Run

1. Clone this repository  
2. Open each task file in a Java IDE (like IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code)  
3. Compile and run the main class for each task  
4. Follow the on-screen menu instructions

---

## 📌 Notes

- All programs are console-based
- Each task is kept in a separate `.java` file for clarity
- Sample data is included in some files like `employees.txt` for testing
